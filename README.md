# Exam Hall Scheduling using AI 📚🤖

This project aims to create an automated exam hall scheduling system using AI techniques. The scheduling process is optimized to ensure minimal conflicts and efficient use of resources.

## Overview 🌟

The project involves the following components:

- Generating a random initial population of exam schedules. 🎲
- Calculating the fitness of each schedule based on specific constraints and conflicts. ⚖️
- Applying tournament selection to choose schedules for the next generation. 🏆
- Employing crossover and mutation operations to create new schedules. 🧬
- Repeating the process for multiple generations to find an optimal solution. 🔁

## Implementation Details 🛠️

- Python code is used to simulate the scheduling process. 🐍
- Randomized initial population of exam schedules for different courses and hall slots. 📅
- Fitness calculation considers hall and time slot conflicts, course-specific conflicts, and hall capacity. 📝
- Tournament selection, crossover, and mutation operations are applied iteratively to evolve the population. 🔄
- The process continues until a satisfying solution is found or a specified number of generations is reached. 🧪

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `project_file.py` file in a Python interpreter or IDE.
3. Run the script to generate optimized exam schedules using AI techniques.
4. Adjust parameters like population size, tournament size, mutation rate, etc., to experiment with the optimization process.
